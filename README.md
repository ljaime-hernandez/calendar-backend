backend created to improve my skills on several node features such as:

* handling HTTP requests with express.js
* connect a server to a database with MongoDB
* create models based on mongoose Schemas
* monitor server changes with nodemon
* encrypt and decrypt passwords with bcryptjs
* validate date fields with custom functions using moment.js
* loads .env file contents into process.env using dotenv
